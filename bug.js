In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route that defines the params.  This leads to an error because the params aren't available in that context.  For example, if you have a route `/users/:userId` and try to access `userId` in a component several levels deep without proper nesting or prop drilling, `useParams()` will return an empty object.
